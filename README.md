### Lane Assistance System

The Lane Assistance System has two functions:

1. Lane departure warning
2. Lane keeping assistance

When the driver drifts towards the edge of the lane, two things will happen:

* the ​lane departure warning function​​ will vibrate the steering wheel
* the​ lane keeping assistance function​​ will move the steering wheel so that the wheels
turn towards the center of the lane
